Visual reinforcement learning, where policies are learned over the image space, are a promising direction for acquiring general robotic skills. Due to the high dimensionality of images, researchers have investigated learning policies over mid-level image representations to make learning tractable. In this work, we investigate how a structured latent state representation can affect RL performance on robotic benchmarks in the OpenAI Gym. We evaluate the reinforcement learning performance of policies using either learned keypoints, true keypoints, or true joint angles on the HalfCheetah and Walker2d continuous control tasks, and find learned keypoints to be competitive with conventional state formats for policy learning.

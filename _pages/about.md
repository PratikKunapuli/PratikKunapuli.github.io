I'm a doctoral student in Computer and Information Science (CIS) at [GRASP](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I am co-advised by [Vijay Kumar](https://www.kumarrobotics.org/) and [Dinesh Jayaraman](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/), and am grateful to be supported by the NSF as a [GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) Fellow. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and robotics, specifically related to using reinforcement learning for control of agile and dynamic systems as well as transferring learning approaches from simulation to the real world (sim2real). 

Previously, I completed both my BSc and MSc at Georgia Institute of Technology in Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my time there, I worked with [Aaron Young](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/young) in the [Exoskeleton Prosthetic Intelligent Controls Lab (EPIC Lab)](http://www.epic.gatech.edu/) initially developing controllers for a powered knee and ankle prosthetic and eventually applying machine learning-based state estimation to autonomous hip exoskeletons. My work culminated in my Masters thesis, "Online Adaptation of User State Estimation in a Powered Hip Exoskeleton using Machine Learning".

Honered that our work [Leveraging Symmetry to Accelerate Learning of Trajectory Tracking Controllers for Free-Flying Robotic Systems](https://pratikkunapuli.github.io/EQTrackingControl/) was awarded the Best Paper Award in the Neuroscience and Interpretability track in the NeurReps Workshop at NeurIPS 2024! This is one of three best paper awards from the workshop, and this work wouldn't have been possible without the oustanding work of my co-first-authors [Jake Welde](https://jakewelde.com) and Nishanth Rao!
